## One descriptor per CLR type resolved through interfaces

A CLR object whose type is not registered, but whose interfaces are, gets a
descriptor that combines the interface descriptors. MoonSharp used to build a
new combined descriptor on every push, so two pushes of the same object were
different values to `DynValue.Equals`, and therefore different table keys.
The combined descriptor is now built once per type and reused.

```lua
-- x and y are the same C# object, pushed twice
local t = {}
t[x] = 1
print(t[y])   -- before: nil   now: 1
```

`x == y` was already true and does not change. Affected: hosts that push
objects of unregistered types implementing registered interfaces and use
them as table keys, or compare `UserData.Descriptor` references.
