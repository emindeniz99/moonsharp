# Migrating

Changes in this fork that a script or a host can observe, newest last. Each
entry says what changed, what it was before and who is affected.

## One descriptor per CLR type resolved through interfaces

A CLR object whose type is not registered, but whose interfaces are, gets a
descriptor that combines the interface descriptors. MoonSharp used to build a
new combined descriptor on every push, so two pushes of the same object were
different values to `DynValue.Equals`, and therefore different table keys.
The combined descriptor is now built once per type and reused.

```lua
-- x and y are the same C# object, pushed twice
local t = {}
t[x] = 1
print(t[y])   -- before: nil   now: 1
```

`x == y` was already true and does not change. Affected: hosts that push
objects of unregistered types implementing registered interfaces and use
them as table keys, or compare `UserData.Descriptor` references.

## Userdata and coroutines no longer share one hash code

`DynValue.GetHashCode` returned 999 for every userdata (other than int64 and
uint64) and every coroutine, so a table keyed by many of them searched all
keys on every lookup. Now:

- a userdata whose CLR type compares by reference (does not override
  `Equals`) hashes by object identity;
- any other userdata hashes by its descriptor, so a key whose `Equals`
  follows state that changes is still found after it changes;
- a coroutine hashes by identity.

Equality is unchanged, and `pairs` order does not depend on hashes.
Affected: hosts that stored `DynValue.GetHashCode()` values.

## Overloaded methods called with many userdata signatures

The overload resolver keeps the last five argument signatures of a method.
When it reused a slot it kept the previous signature's userdata types, so a
later call could match the wrong slot and run the wrong overload or fail
with "cannot convert". It now clears the slot. Affected: scripts calling an
overloaded method with more than five different userdata argument types.

## Methods on structs mutate the userdata in every access mode

A method on a struct called from a script, for example `v:Increment()`,
changed the boxed struct inside the userdata under
`InteropAccessMode.Reflection`, but only a copy of it under
`LazyOptimized`, `Preoptimized` and `BackgroundOptimized`, so the change
was lost. The compiled adapters now call the method on the struct inside
its box, so every mode changes the userdata.

```lua
v:Increment()
print(v.Count)   -- before: 0 in the optimized modes, 1 with Reflection   now: 1
```

Affected: hosts exposing structs with mutating methods. Hardwired
descriptors are generated code that casts the receiver to a copy; they keep
the old behaviour.

## Reading a method from a userdata returns the same callback

Each read of a method from a userdata, which includes every
`obj:Method()` call, built a new callback bound to that userdata. The
userdata now keeps its last two bound callbacks and returns them again, so:

```lua
print(obj.Method == obj.Method)          -- before: false   now: true
print(rawequal(obj.Method, obj.Method))  -- before: false   now: true
print(obj.Method == other.Method)        -- false, as before
```

The kept callback is read-only and is dropped when the descriptor's members
change (`AddMember`, `RemoveMember`, a new extension method found by
name). Overloads and extension methods are still resolved at each call.
Affected: scripts that compared method values, and hosts that set
`CallbackFunction.AdditionalData` on a callback read from a userdata
(the object is now shared by later reads).

## Named enum values pushed from the CLR share one userdata

A CLR enum value with a name in a registered enum, returned by a method or
pushed with `UserData.Create` or `DynValue.FromObject`, now reuses the
read-only value the enum descriptor holds for that name, as `MyEnum.A` in a
script already did, instead of a new userdata each time. Equality,
`tostring` and table keys are unchanged. Affected: hosts that call
`Assign` on such a value (it is read-only, like `DynValue.Nil`), or that
attach a `UserValue` (`debug.setuservalue`) to one enum value and expect
other pushes of the same value not to see it.

## Flags functions return enum values

`flagsAnd`, `flagsOr`, `flagsXor` and `flagsNot` on a registered `[Flags]`
enum returned a userdata wrapping the bare underlying number (a boxed
`int`, `ushort`, ...), not a value of the enum type. So it printed as a
number and never compared equal to the enum's members:

```lua
print(MyFlags.flagsOr(MyFlags.A, MyFlags.B))                  -- before: 3      now: A, B
print(MyFlags.flagsOr(MyFlags.A, MyFlags.B) == MyFlags.AB)    -- before: false  now: true
```

They now return values of the enum type. Affected: scripts that printed or
compared these results, and hosts that received them as `object`.

## Objects with script event handlers can be collected

An event descriptor is shared by every script and lives as long as the
type's registration. It kept each object that had a script handler, the
handler closures and so their scripts, in plain dictionaries, so none of
them were ever collected unless the script removed every handler. It now
holds the object weakly: while the object lives its handlers live and
fire as before; once the host drops the object, the object, its handlers
and a script referenced only by them can be collected. Affected: hosts
that relied on a script staying alive only because one of its functions
handled an event of an object nobody else referenced (such an event could
never fire again anyway).

## Background optimization no longer ends the process

With `InteropAccessMode.BackgroundOptimized`, the thread-pool work item
that compiles adapters walked a type's overload list while the first
script call sorted it. The resulting exception was unhandled on a pool
thread, which ends the process. The work item now walks copies of the
lists and ignores a failure: members it did not optimize keep running
through reflection, as they do before it finishes. Affected: hosts using
`BackgroundOptimized` with overloaded methods.

## Exceptions from C# methods called through reflection

A C# method that threw, called from Lua through reflection, reached the
host as a `TargetInvocationException` wrapping the real exception; through
the compiled path it reached the host as itself. Reflection is what
`InteropAccessMode.Reflection` uses, what every call uses on AOT platforms
(IL2CPP, iOS), and what a `BackgroundOptimized` method uses until it is
compiled. The original exception is now rethrown on every path, with its
stack trace. Affected: hosts on IL2CPP or iOS, or using `Reflection`, that
caught `TargetInvocationException` and read `InnerException`.

## The Unity package requires Unity 2021.3

`package.json` of `org.moonsharp.moonsharp` and
`org.moonsharp.debugger.vscode` declares `"unity": "2021.3"` (it was
`2020.3`). The fork targets Unity 2021.3 LTS, 2022.3 LTS and Unity 6 LTS,
which `.github/workflows/unity.yml` tests; 2020.3 is out of support and was
never tested. Nothing in the package needed the lower number. Affected: projects on Unity 2020.3.
